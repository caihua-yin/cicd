# Shell module83 is often the last resort since it does not work with states.
# In most cases, commands run as through shell will not check whether something
# is in the correct state or not and run every time we execute Ansible playbook.
# However, etcd always runs only a single instance and there is no risk that
# multiple executions of this command will produce multiple instances.
